# Up-Counter-on-FPGA-Arty-A7-100T-
This project implements a 3-bit up counter on the Digilent Arty A7-100T FPGA board using Verilog HDL. The counter increments on every clock pulse and is displayed on on-board LEDs. A clock divider is used to slow down the counting speed so that the LED transitions are clearly visible to the human eye.
